The code prints different analysis on the logs file. To run the code
all you need to do is to supply the code a path to txt file containing logs.
The code uses ua-agent to parse the user agent and GeoIP2 database for extracting countries by there IP.
The code can be easily extend to analyze more categories, by implementing the interface CategoryAnalyzer,
and add the new category to the analyzers' list in the main function.

# Log Analyzer Tool

## Overview

The Log Analyzer Tool processes logs, parses the `User-Agent` string, and extracts country information from IP
 addresses using the GeoIP2 database.

 The code can be easily extend to analyze more categories, by implementing the interface CategoryAnalyzer,
 and add the new category to the list of analyzers in the main function.


## Requirements
- Java 21
- ua-agent library version 1.5.2 for User-Agent parsing
- GeoIP2 version 4.2.0 database for country detection
